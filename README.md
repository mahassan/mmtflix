# How to run locally
- Download or clone from the link of repo
- Choose place on your system to clone
- Once downloaded unzip it
- If you cloned it, Open in your Editor (I recommend VS Code) and open terminal
- Run `npm i` short for `npm install`, this will install all the dependency.
- After it has done, run `npm run start` and it will fire up your local server on localhost
- Enjoy! ðŸš€

- - p.s - if any issue, don't forget to raise a PR.
